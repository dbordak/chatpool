* Show chat invitation when pool>0
* Email transcript
  - figure out how to use sendmail?
* Rep rating
  - requires an additional table (see below)
* Provide active-panel info to rep
* API
  - /api/v1/rep/list        GET list of reps
  - /api/v1/rep/:id/name    GET, POST rep's name
  - /api/v1/rep/:id/conv    GET list of conversations involving rep :id
  - /api/v1/conv/:id        GET, DELETE conversation
* (done) DB
  - rep table [name, id, uid]
  - conv table [user-uid, rep-id, active]
  - cust table [name, email, uid, active-panel?]
  - message table [from, body, conv-id]
  - rating table [cust, rep, message, score]

  - id = row id, uid = socket identifier. Customers do not have ids,
    since they are only identified by the current session (e.g. if
    they log out and log in, the server will generate a new uid for
    them -- the old db entry is no longer used.)
* UPDATE: split names into first/last
  - reflect this in UI or just hide it?
* Make it look better
* Session persistence?
* Docker
* Heroku?
* Confirmation message (modal) when quitting chat. Verify intent and
  desire for transcript.
* Reps should not be able to close the chat panel.
* Chat message server->client... messages... should contain whether
  the sender is the rep or cust for CSS purposes.
